Sometimes the formality of meetups is too much. This group exists to socialize and show off your latest piece of hardware. If it's a simple Arduino based thingamabob or your company's newest hardware product (and how you earn your living), you should consider attending. The main focus is meeting like minded people who are building fun things (with atoms!).
